\section{$\mu$PL Results and Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item 10QW experiments\\
\* PL image and raw img, PL deviation small. Estimate smoothing, estimate resolution, comment on disorder agreement with thry.
\item 4QW experiment\\
\* PL image and raw img, PL deviation slightly larger, but still small estimate, estimate rez, comment on disorder agreement with thry.
\item IQD experiment\\
\* Introduce IQD, talk about disorder in IQD, show raw image, explain difference btwn IQD, MQW, estimate rez, comment on agreement with thry.


\end{itemize}
\section{PLE Results and Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item PLE curve analysis\\
show stock PLE curve, show slices, say what they mean, show peaks, say what peaks mean
\item PLE anti-stokes.
show anti-stokes t dep. curves\\
show anti-stokes pow-dep curves, talk about linearity or no, comment on CCD bs., \\
compare with thry, talk about mechanisms. well width dep
\item PLE stokes peak\\
show stokes pow-dep curves, talk about linearity or no, comment on CCD bs., \\
compare with thry, talk about well width dep, say mechanisms understood(?) point to lit chris and I found

\end{itemize}
