\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces A typical dispersion curve minima for a direct-gap semiconductor. An optical transition is illustrated at $\mathaccentV {vec}17E{k} = 0$, where an electron is emitting a photon as the result of a transition from the conduction band to the valance band.}}{6}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces A graphical representation of the one-dimensional infinite potential well of width $L$.}}{7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces The band structure of GaAs, the allowed states are the thick horizontal curves, and the boxed region is the direct-gap region, in which electrons can be photo-excited across the gap. Note, the minima of this region look like the dispersion curve in 2.4\hbox {}.}}{10}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.4}{\ignorespaces An example of the semiconductor quantum well. These layers can be repeated arbitrarily many times with arbitrary dimension and thickness for many types of application.}}{10}
