@article{zou_microphotoluminescence_2014,
	Abstract = {ZnSe nanoribbons were synthesized and characterized with microphotoluminescence (mu-PL) spectra and mappings. The mu-PL results show that the near band edge (BE) and the deep defect (DD) level related emissions are predominantly located at the central and the edge region of the ribbons, respectively. Combining with the HRTEM, the DD related emission is attributed to the structure defects mainly located at the edge of the ribbon. It is found that the DD related emission consists of three bands, centered at 635, 560 and 535 nm, respectively. The temperature dependent PL spectra further demonstrate that the carriers transfer among the different defect states through the thermally activated mechanism. The results provide more direct evidence about the origin of trap state related emissions in ZnSe nanostructures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{dai_ultraviolet_2014,
	Abstract = {ZnO micro-Letrapod microstructures were fabricated by a vapor phase transport method. Under the excitation of 325 nm continuous wave He-Cd laser, the microphotoluminescence spectrum from a single ZnO micro-tetrapod presented a two-band structure with a series of optical resonance modes; a possible optical resonance loop formed in two adjacent legs of the tetrapod was suggested, and the two-band spectrum structure was attributed to the exciton-exciton scattering process. The lasing emission was obtained from single ZnO micro-tetrapod under intense excitation of 355 nm nanosecond pulsed land The lasing spectrum shows clear mode structure with the lasing quality factor of 1300 and the lasing threshold of 150 kW/cm(2). The microphotoluminescence resonance and lasing results indicate that ZnO tetrapod can serve as a high-Q ultraviolet microcavity laser. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {A single nanoscale object containing a set of InGaN/GaN nonpolar multiple-quantum wells has been analyzed by microphotoluminescence spectroscopy (mu PL), high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT). The correlated measurements constitute a rich and coherent set of data supporting the interpretation that the observed mu PL narrow emission lines, polarized perpendicularly to the crystal c-axis and with energies in the interval 2.9-3.3 eV, are related to exciton states localized in potential minima induced by the irregular 3D In distribution within the quantum well (QW) planes. This novel method opens up interesting perspectives, as it will be possible to apply it on a wide class of quantum confining emitters and nano-objects.},

@article{kudrawiec_photoreflectance_2013,
	Abstract = {Optical transitions in as-grown and annealed GaN0.02As0.98, Ga0.95In0.05N0.02As0.98, and GaN0.02As0.90Sb0.08 bulklike layers have been studied with photoreflectance (PR), photoluminescence (PL), and microphotoluminescence (mu PL) in a broad range of temperatures. The exciton binding energy and the temperature dependence of the energy gap have been determined from PR measurements. In addition, the alloy-related broadening of optical transitions has been analyzed and compared for the three alloys. The largest alloy inhomogeneities have been observed for GaN0.02As0.90Sb0.08. In mu PL spectra of GaN0.02As0.98 and Ga0.95In0.05N0.02As0.98 layers measured at low temperatures and low excitation conditions, sharp PL lines of 100-300-mu eV widths have been clearly observed similar to 10-20 meV below the energy gap of these alloys. Analyzing the temperature quenching of the sharp PL lines, they have been attributed to the recombination of localized excitons trapped at deep donor (acceptor)-like states. Such lines were not well resolved for GaN0.02As0.90Sb0.08 layers. The analysis of thermal quenching of localized exciton emission suggests that for this alloy excitons are localized mostly on alloy content fluctuations. With the increase in the excitation power an additional PL band has been observed in mu PL spectra at the higher-energy side. This band corresponds to the optical transitions between delocalized states which are observed in photoreflectance spectra. The emission of localized excitons without resolved sharp lines has been also observed with macro-PL measurements at low temperatures. In addition, the donor trap-valence band (DT-VB) recombination has been identified for the three alloys in macro-PL spectra. It has been clearly observed that the intensity of DT-VB recombination is the weakest for GaN0.02As0.90Sb0.08 alloys whereas for GaN0.02As0.98 and Ga0.95In0.05N0.02As0.98 alloys it is very similar. The observed differences between the three alloys and the role of postgrowth annealing have been analyzed and discussed in the context of the influence of III-V host on alloy inhomogeneities, formation of native point defects in III-V-N alloys, and their influence on the optical quality of III-V-N alloys.},

	Abstract = {We study the coupling of cavities defined by the local modulation of the waveguide width using confocal photoluminescence microscopy. We are able to spatially map the profile of the antisymmetric (antibonding) and symmetric (bonding) modes of a pair of strongly coupled cavities (photonic molecule) and follow the coupled cavity system from the strong coupling to the weak coupling regime in the presence of structural disorder. The effect of disorder on this photonic molecule is also investigated numerically with a finite-difference time-domain method and a semi-analytical approach, which enables us to quantify the light localization observed in either cavity as a function of detuning.

@article{grossberg_microphotoluminescence_2013,
	Abstract = {Microphotoluminescence studies of Cu2ZnSnS4 polycrystals were performed. At room temperature, two photoluminescence (PL) bands were detected at 1.39 and 1.53 eV and attributed to band-to-tail (BT) and band-to-band (BB) recombination, respectively. At lower temperatures, band-to-impurity recombination always dominates. The results show that the model of heavily doped semiconductors applies to Cu2ZnSnS4 and that, in contrast to the ternary chalcopyrites, the BT recombination in Cu2ZnSnS4 has very low intensity. The laser power dependency of the PL intensity shows that the recombination mechanism of BT and BB bands exhibits an exciton-like behavior.
