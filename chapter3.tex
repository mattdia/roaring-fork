\chapter{Experimental Methods}
In this chapter I will describe the experiments I conducted for this thesis. The first section will deal cover the configuration and customization of the continuous wave (CW) Titanium Sapphire laser I used as an excitation source for conducting both PLE and $\mu$PL experiments. Section two will cover the design and construction of the in-cryostat optic mount for the $\mu$PL experiment as well as the optical configuration for data collection. Section three will illustrate the data collection procedure used in $\mu$PL experiments, as well as the function and implementation of LabView code I wrote for hardware control and data acquisition. In section four, I will lay out the optical design of our PLE experiments and in section five, I will discuss the experimental data collection process and signal optimization routines.

\section{The Light Source}
\indent The PLE and $\mu$PL experiments required a stable CW laser light source with fairly high-power and narrow line-width. For $\mu$PL, it was important that we have a fairly Gaussian and symmetric beam so we could obtain the desired spot-size and resolution at the sample. Additionally, conducting PLE scans required that we have the ability to computer control the laser wavelength over a range of wavelengths, roughly a spectral region from $\lambda = 780$nm to $\lambda = 850$nm. The laser we used for this task was a Schwartz Electro Optics Titan-CW Titanium Sapphire (Ti:Sapph) laser. Its specifications were fairly close to our needs, as its specified operating power is 500mW with a tunable range from roughly 700-820nm \cite{SEO}. 

\indent The laser cavity can be configured for either CW or pulsed operation. In CW operation a 532nm pump beam, 5W of power, enters the cavity through a series of steering mirrors. After entering, the pump passes through a lens to focus the pump on the Ti:Sapph crystal. When the beam leave the gain medium, the remaining pump light passes through the end mirror and terminates at the back of the laser enclosure. The laser configuration is shown in Figure 3.1.

\end{figure}

\indent Though the Ti:Sapph laser nearly met our specifications, it required two modifications to be operable in our experiments. First, we needed to add a computer controlled actuator to rotate the the birefringent tuner in order to allow for increased tunability and repeatability relative to the original manually actuated micrometer. We modified the rotation mount for the birefringent filter (BRF) to accommodate a Newport TRB25 linear actuator. The linear actuator pushed a spring-loaded arm to rotate the BRF to a specified angle and select our desired wavelength. Figure \ref{brfmount} depicts the modified BRF mount with the actuator attached.

\section{Optical Components and Optical Path Configuration for $\mu$PL Experiments}

\subsection{Manufacturing the SIL}

\indent In order to obtain the resolution necessary to image disorder, the experiment employed a solid immersion lens (SIL) at the surface of the sample to increase the index of refraction at the imaging plane. I chose ZnSe as the SIL material, as its index of refraction at 780nm is n=2.53 \cite{refindex}, high enough to give us a diffraction limit near the disorder feature size. However, ZnSe SILs are not commercially available, so we resorted to manufacturing SILs from a stock ZnSe window. The window measured 2.54cm diameter by 1cm thickness, and our goal was to manufacture SILs of roughly 3mm in radius. To begin, we used a core drill, diameter 6.35mm, to cut out a cylindrical chunk of ZnSe. We then centered and glued the cylindrical stock material to a brass dowel, 2mm in radius. After the ZnSe was glued to the rod, the SIL shaping began. We put the brass dowel in a power drill and used 220 grit sandpaper to shape the ZnSe cylinder roughly into a hemisphere.

\indent  When the SIL was in the roughly correct shape, we lapped and polished the hemispherical surface until the SIL was the correct size. Additionally, since the experiment required optical quality surfaces, this was a careful and fairly lengthy process. I made the polishing lapps by machining a 2.54cm diameter copper rod to roughly 2cm in diameter with a 1.8cm wide by 1cm deep cavity. Then, I melted lead solder into the cavity, let it harden, and machined the face of the copper and solder until they were flush and mahcine-smooth. Then, I pressed a cleaned, 6.35mm dieameter ball bearing halfway into the solder. Figure 3.3 depicts what a finished lapp looked like before it was used to grind and polish the SIL. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width = .3\textwidth]{lapp.eps}
\caption{ \doublespacing A depiction of the lapp. The orange casing is copper while the grey lining is lead solder. The cavity left by the ball bearing was smooth enough to polish the relatively soft ZnSe hemispheres to an optical quality finish.}
\label{lapp}
\end{figure}



\indent After the lapp was made, we mounted the dowel with the SIL attached to a glass-working lathe. As the lathe rotated, we placed the lapp with a mixture of diamond polishing solution and mineral oil onto the SIL and held it in place with a sharpened wire. The wire and Lapp were set off-center relative to the SIL so the friction of the rotating SIL would randomly move the lapp so as to evenly polish the surface of the hemisphere. A depiction of this setup is in figure \ref{polish}. We iterated polishing runs, changing the lapp each time we stepped down in grit size (from 10$\mu$m to 5 $\mu$m to 1$\mu$m to 0.5$\mu$m). We then polished the hemisphere in a new lapp filled with 0.3$\mu$m colloidal silica polishing solution. After the polishing process finished, the SIL was removed from the dowel and the flat surface was polished on a flat lapp with colloidal silicon mixture. When the process finished, we had a hemispherical (to within 1\%) ZnSe SIL.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Manufacturing the Cryostat Optics Mount}
\indent In order to achieve the desired imaging resolution, our chosen optical geometry (refer to Figure \ref{confocal2}) required a high-NA lens as the imaging lens. We therefore chose an Edmund Optics $0.83NA$, 9mm effective focal length aspheric lens. Together with our ZnSe SIL, this gave us an Abbe diffraction limit of $d = 185.05$nm for PL centered around $\lambda = 780$nm. This diffraction limit is less than our goal of $d = 200$nm. As our experiment required cooling to cryogenic temperatures, we had to build a mechanically and thermally stable optics platform to hold the lenses and QW sample together in the correct configuration. Therefore, working with our machinists, I designed an optics mount to hold the in-cryostat optical components which are seen in Figure \ref{mount}. The optics mount stands vertically in our Cryo-Con 8CN bath cryostat. Therefore, since the excitation laser enters the cryostat vertically, we designed the optics mount to be held to a mirror which filled the entire optics mount and was positioned at a 45 degree angle so as to direct the laser to the sample and capture the total PL image. The mirror was ground by taking a stock Thor Labs 2.54cm diameter mirror, protecting the silvered face with weak glass tape, cutting the mirror to 3mm thick, and securing the mirror to an aluminum rod of 15mm diameter (the same diameter as the inside of the optic mount). The end of the rod was bevelled at 45 degrees, and the mirror and rod combination was spun by hand on the side of a glass cutting saw blade. This process ensured that, when the glass was cut flush with the edge of the rod, the mirror was the correct elliptical shape and diameter to fit in the optics mount. The mirror was then secured to a roughly .5mm thick sheet of indium (to prevent the mirror cracking due to thermal expansion and contraction. This sheet of indium was then epoxied to the mirror mount.

There was a thin teflon ring between the asphere, the SIL, and their retaining rings to allow for limited thermal expansion and contraction of the lenses without damage.}

\subsection{Experimental Optical Path Configuration}
\indent Our aim was to characterize disorder over an area roughly $200\mu$m in diameter. In order to do so, we needed the laser spotsize to be $200\mu$m in diameter or larger, and we had to collect the PL emitted over this diameter. Additionally, to obtain clear images, the excitation spot needed to be monotonic, symmetric, and preferably Gaussian in shape. To this end, I characterized the laser spot size and found it to be $1.6\pm.1$mm FWHM diameter, roughly Gaussian and symmetric to within 20\%. In order to obtain the requisite beam diameter at the sample, it was necessary to resize the beam going into the cryostat. In order to do so, we used a succession of four lenses to resize the beam. The first two lenses, one of focal length 60mm and the other of focal length 25.4mm, shrunk our beam from 1.6mm to 0.68mm. The second lens in the second pair of lenses was the in-cryostat asphere, and in combination with the lens outside the cryostat, focal length 30mm, resized our beam to $203\mu$m in diameter. After the beam hit the sample, the PL signal travelled through the asphere and out of the cryostat. We placed a 90\% reflective non-polarizing beamsplitter (NPBS) outside the cryostat to pick off the PL signal. The beamsplitter sent the PL signal through an achromatic, 20cm focal length lens, and a polarizer to filter out the laser. Finally, the signal was then focused onto the slit of a Horiba iHR550 imaging spectrometer with a Horiba Synapse imaging CCD camera. The 20cm lens was 50.4cm in diameter and mounted to a linear translation stage. Its function was to both focus the PL spot on the spectrometer slit and translate the image across the spectrometer slit, as in Figure \ref{slit}. The PL image was roughly 9mm in radius at the lens, so since the lens was relatively large compared to the image, spherical image aberrations during image translation were negligible.
\indent We monitored the laser power with a photodiode, using the light that was dumped out of the experiment by the NPBS. Additionally, between the NPBS and the moveable lens, we had the option to add a telescope to improve the magnification of the system further. The use of the telescope depended on the intensity of the signal. If the signal was vanishingly small, the telescope made it nearly unreadable. Therefore, in cases where less signal reached the spectrometer, the telescope became impractical.

\section{$\mu$PL Data Collection}
\subsection{Optical Alignment Considerations}
\indent When the optical components were roughly in the configuration seen in Figure \ref{upl}, we cooled the sample to $10\pm1$K and adjusted the laser power to $10.0\pm0.1$mW so that the laser power at the sample was roughly 1mW at the sample (because the NPBS dumped 90\% of the power we fed into it). We identified the PL signal using a polarization filter, as it was the only signal left after the filter was rotated such that its polarization was orthogonal to that of the beam reflected from the sample. We set the position of the 30cm lens by maximizing the size of the PL image while monitoring it with an IR viewer as we adjusted the position of the lens. Then, we experimentally adjusted the focus of the moveable lens to maximize the spatial differences seen in PL amplitude on the CCD. Finally, we put the polarizer just in front of the spectrometer slit and rotated it to cut out as much laser scatter from the signal as possible.

\subsection{Data Collection Process}
\indent The data collection process was fairly simple. The spectrometer CCD recorded an intensity image 1024x2048 pixels large. The vertical pixel dimension corresponded to vertical spatial dimension on the sample, while the horizontal pixel dimension corresponded to PL emission wavelength and both axes could be calibrated such that we could read peak emission wavelength as a function of vertical sample position. Each image we recorded was effectively a vertical slice of the larger two dimensional PL image. Because we step-translated the PL image across the spectrometer slit and took an image at each lens position, we could recover both PL intensity and PL energy as a function of position. This is exactly the information required to reconstruct a spatial map of QW disorder. 

\indent The computer control of the experiment involved five pieces of hardware: two linear actuators, a photodiode, the spectrometer and the imaging CCD. The photodiode was read by the analog-to-digital converter of a Stanford SRS 810 lock-in amplifier using General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) protocol. The lens translation stage was actuated by a Newport TRB12 linear actuator, and it was controlled (along with the laser wavelength adjustment) by a Newport ESP300 motion controller interfaced through GPIB. Both the Horiba spectrometer and CCD interfaced over USB. The manufacturers of each of the above devices wrote LabView interface code which I incorporated into my overall experimental control code. The experimental control and data acquisition process proceeded according to the flowchart in Figure \ref{flowit}. The collected images and photodiode readings were handled and analyzed with MATLAB code that I wrote.

\section{Components and Optical Path Configuration for PLE Experiments}
\subsection{Optical Path Configuration and Alignment}
Because we didn't need to image the PL from the QW sample in PLE experiments, the optical configuration simplified immensely. The laser first went into an NPBS where about 10\% of its power was directed at a photodiode to monitor the laser power during acquisition. From there, the laser travelled to a 7.5cm focusing lens. The lens focused the laser onto our InGaAs/GaAs QW samples, which were rotated at 45 degrees with respect to the laser path to minimize reflected laser light arriving at the spectrometer. The sample was kept in a Janis STVP-400 helium vapor flow cryostat with tunable temperature control. The PL signal was collected by the same 7.5cm focusing lens, and then sent through a polarizing beam splitter whose polarization was orthogonal to the laser's. Following the beamsplitter, the PL signal was sent to the same achromatic 20cm focal length lens used as the moveable lens in the $\mu$PL experiments. After the lens, the PL signal passed through another polarizer rotated orthogonally to the laser polarization to minimize the laser light entering the spectrometer. The signal then passed into the spectrometer where it was collected as a spectral trace instead of a spectral image. We took data over an area of the CCD which measured 100x2048 pixels. We then integrated over the vertical pixels and recorded spectra which were intensity vs. horizontal pixel number which we calibrated to wavelength. Figure \ref{PLE} is a diagram of the experimental setup. Note, we modified the laser slightly by replacing the output coupler with one coated to work at wavelengths longer than 800nm so we could sweep the laser wavelength out to 850 or 860nm during PLE runs. Only negligible changes to the beamsize and output power resulted from this change.

\label{PLE}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Collection for Photoluminescence Excitation Spectroscopy}
The PLE data runs were fairly similar to those used for taking $\mu$PL data. The computer interfaced with the spectrometer, the photodiode, and the laser wavelength actuation in the same way. During the data collection process, we monitored PL intensity as a function of wavelength, recorded these spectra, and then changed the excitation wavelength of the laser. The sets of PLE spectra, BRF actuator position, and PD signal were collected and processed using MATLAB and Igor. Figure \ref{flowitple} is a flowchart representing the LabView code I wrote for the data collection process.
